      Depending on the context, Asc Academics may act as:

      <li>
        a <strong>data controller</strong> when we determine the purposes and means of processing personal data
        (for example, HR administration, client contact details, website data);
      </li>
      <li>
        a <strong>data processor</strong> when we process personal data on behalf of a client and follow their
        documented instructions (for example, when analysing client-provided datasets in consultancy or research projects).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When we act as a processor, the client remains responsible for providing information to data subjects and
      for defining the lawful basis for processing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such data may appear in <strong>pseudonymised or de-identified datasets</strong> provided by clients for research

      services, or consent where required by law. You can object to or unsubscribe from marketing communications at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Minimisation and Accuracy</h2>
    <p>
      We limit the personal data we collect and process to what is necessary for the purposes described in this Policy.
      We take reasonable steps to keep personal data accurate and up to date. You can help us by informing us if your
      details change.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We do not keep personal data longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or longer than
      required by law.
    </p>
    <p>In general:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Client and project-related data</strong> is kept for <strong>five (5) years</strong> after the end of
        the client relationship, unless a longer period is required by Dutch or EU law (for example for tax or accounting
        purposes) or agreed in a client contract.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Supplier and contract data</strong> is kept for <strong>five (5) years</strong> after the end of the
        contract, unless law requires a longer period.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Job applicant data</strong> is normally kept for up to <strong>one (1) year</strong> after the recruitment
        process, unless you consent to a longer retention for future opportunities or law requires a different period.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Employee data</strong> is retained in line with Dutch employment and tax rules, which may require
        retention for several years after the end of employment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Client-provided datasets</strong> processed by us as a processor are retained only for the duration
        specified in the relevant contract or instructions, after which they are deleted or returned, unless we are
        legally obliged to retain them for longer.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When data is no longer needed, we delete it or irreversibly anonymise it.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Recipients of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
      We may share personal data with:
    </p>
    <ul>

    </p>

    <h2>9. International Transfers of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
      Asc Academics is based in the Netherlands but may work with clients, suppliers or partners located outside the
      <strong>European Economic Area (EEA)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If personal data is transferred to a country outside the EEA that does not provide an adequate level of protection
      according to the European Commission, we will ensure that the transfer complies with GDPR requirements, for example by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>using <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong> approved by the European Commission; and</li>
      <li>implementing additional safeguards where necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can contact us at <a href="mailto:it@ascacademics.com">it@ascacademics.com</a> for more information about the
      specific safeguards used for international transfers.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Security of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
      We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>unauthorised access;</li>
      <li>accidental or unlawful destruction;</li>
      <li>loss, alteration or disclosure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Measures may include, where appropriate:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>access controls and authentication;</li>
      <li>secure configurations and regular updates;</li>

      <li>regular backups;</li>
      <li>staff confidentiality obligations and awareness training;</li>
      <li>vendor risk management.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Although we take reasonable steps to protect personal data, no system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
    </p>
